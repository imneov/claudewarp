## What is ClaudeWarp?

ClaudeWarp connects your Claude Code environment to your chat apps.

It turns any Claude runtime — CLI, API, or script — into a **remotely accessible agent**.

You can:

* 🧠 Send prompts to Claude from anywhere
* 👀 Receive outputs and logs instantly in chat
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Share the session with others
* 🪄 Build chat-based workflows powered by Claude
